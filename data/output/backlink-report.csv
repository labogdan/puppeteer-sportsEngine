We spent a few years in Fall Ball Leagues and quickly realized that we can be much more efficient and productive with the 4 hours that we used to spend on game action which included only 3 at bats and a few live balls hit to you for example. Our Fall Ball Program is a great opportunity for us to develop a relationship with players who will be with us for the 2021 season prior to our Winter Workouts, as well as being open to players who want to improve their game within a 6-week time frame. Structure: Development once again is our main focus, so we will provide you with a ton of our Vikings coaches... , ,  Sep 12, 2020 - Oct 19, 2020 ,  $375
